Many very interesting theories have been floated, and certainly they all make sense to me: the lack of a modern scientific approach, the lack of a powerful bourgeoisie, the excessive power of the emperor, the insularity of the system and the country, China not discovering the American continent and not projecting itself into foreign colonies, et cetera.</p>

                                    <p><strong>1.1 The people of Italy at the turn of the millennium</strong>
According to a myth the name Italy comes from an ancient Italian language, possibly Etruscan1 meaning the “land of Bulls” <em>uitalia</em>. Yet the origin is still controversial. According to another Greek tradition the name comes from Italo king of the Enotrians, who ruled parts of the Peninsula, in the South, sixteen generations before the war of Troy, that would be then around 1700 BC.2</p>

                                    <p>The Greeks came to southern Italy in many waves after the 8th century BC, when the Doric tribes from north of Greece took over the peninsula held by the Achaeans, also Greeks but of different stocks. It is possible that early Greek settlers arrived there one or two centuries before. After all, Ulysses, according to the Odyssey, referring to around the 12th century BC, came to Italy, where he met the monsters Scylla and Charybdis (the mythical creatures symbolizing the strong currents pushing boats against the Calabrian and Sicilian shores in the Strait of Messina) and the Cyclops, whose mythical home was close to the Etna volcano in Sicily. On both occasions, he barely survived.</p>
