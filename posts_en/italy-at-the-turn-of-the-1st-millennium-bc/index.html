                                    <p><strong>1.1 The people of Italy at the turn of the millennium</strong>
According to a myth the name Italy comes from an ancient Italian language, possibly Etruscan1 meaning the “land of Bulls” <em>uitalia</em>. Yet the origin is still controversial. According to another Greek tradition the name comes from Italo king of the Enotrians, who ruled parts of the Peninsula, in the South, sixteen generations before the war of Troy, that would be then around 1700 BC.2</p>

<p>It was at about that time that Italy made its first literary apparition as home of some fantastical creatures in the Odyssey, the poem attributed to Homer at the foundation of western civilization. In the poem, Italy is home of the beautiful and deceptive sirens, possibly located north of Messina, of the monsters Scylla and Charybdis, the dangerous coasts of Calabria and Sicily in their most narrow place. It hosts the god of winds and the scariest giant Cyclops, sons of the king of hell, set in antiquity in Sicily, within Mount Etna, the largest active Volcano of the Mediterranean. It was in sum for ancient Greeks a mythical place, not home of humans but of fantastic creatures.</p>

<p>In any event, at the turn of the first millennium BC, Italy was a strange mix of local and later Indo-European populations, mostly loosely related to one another and constantly at war with each other. They were relatively backwards, compared with the three large and important civilizations that came from outside and were fighting to gain the upper hand in the peninsula.</p>

<p>The first of three civilizations, each of which we shall follow in some detail, are the Etruscans, located in what is modern Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, and Emilia down to Rome. They were possibly originally from Anatolia, speaking a mysterious non-Indo-European language and mixed with the local population. Possibly ethnically close to them there were the <em>Elimes</em>, living in the western tip of Sicily. Then there were the Indo-European Greeks, occupying the southern coast from Naples to eastern Sicily. And in western Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica there were the Phoenicians from Carthage, of Semitic stock.</p>

<p>The main local tribes are not without interest.</p>

<p>The strangest of all are possibly the <em>Nuraghi</em>, a civilization from Sardinia that left the largest megalithic structures of antiquity, the Nuraghi, some kind of towers whose function is still unknown. They are said to be watch posts, forts, or abodes for giants. It is not clear at all. The Nuraghi were built from around 1,700 BC to the 2nd century BC. Its people are said to be warriors and seafarers, and some Sardinian scholars think they may be the Sea People that brought huge disruption to Egypt and the Hittite empire in the eastern Mediterranean in the 13th century BC. For this there is scant evidence besides the fact that Egyptians called the Sea People “<em>shardens</em>,” something that sounds like the modern name “Sardinia.”</p>

<p>The origin of the Nuraghi population is unknown, but it is possible they were pre-Indo-European, like the modern Basques living between Spain and France3. Another pre-Indo-European population was that of the <em>Castellieri</em> (castle builders)4, who built forts in the mountain area around modern Trieste in Northern Italy. Also, with a mysterious origin (perhaps proto Illyric or from Asia Minor) were the Veneti, living in the northeast.</p>

<p>In Northern Italy, in the Po valley, there were the belligerent Indo-European <em>Gauls</em>, closely related to their brethren living on the other side of the Alps, in what is now France. Close to them there were the <em>Ligurians,</em> who got mixed with the Celtic Gauls, although originally might have been non-Indo-Europeans.</p>

<p>In central and southern Italy there were the <em>Samnites</em>, a fierce population that posed the first threat to the Romans in their expansion into central Italy. Related to them were the ferocious <em>Lucani</em> and the <em>Brutii</em> in what are now Basilicata and Calabria, and the <em>Japigi</em> and <em>Messapi</em> in modern Puglia. All these are peoples who fought the Greek expansion and then went to the Roman side when Rome pushed south.5</p>

<p>In the middle of them there were the Latins, an Indo-European tribe living in an area that was originally made of fertile volcanic soil.</p>

<p>We have little or no writing left of these people, although we can infer the early Romans’ degree of civilization was about the same as that of the Latin, who from pretty early on had a written language—the Latin script we now use, derived from the Greek Alphabet. It is then possible that the Romans destroyed all other competing scripts and histories to impose their own version of events for the future.</p>

<p>The tribe took its name from the myth that Olympus’ highest God Jupiter for a time hid from his father Saturn (in the Latin mythology the god of agricultural abundance; in the Greek mythology it corresponded to Kronos, also the god of time). Jupiter (Zeus in Greek) hid (<em>latuisset</em>) from Saturn there.6</p>

<p>Their recognized cultural and religious center was a large, extinct volcano, Mons Albanus (“the Alban Mount,” today’s Colli Albani), some 20 kilometers to the southeast of Rome. In its center is a crater lake, Lacus Albanus, oval in shape and a few km long and wide. At the top of the second-highest peak (Monte Cavo) was a temple to Jupiter Latiaris, where the Latini held state functions before their subjugation by Rome and where the Romans subsequently held religious and state ceremonies.</p>

<p>However before getting to the Romans, we must first discover the three civilizations that dominated the peninsula before the Roman rise. These three civilizations all had ties with Troy, the semi-mythical city destroyed by the league of Achaeans some time in the 12th or 13th century BC. The Phoenicians of Carthage rose in fact thanks to the chaos in the eastern Mediterranean at the time of the war of Troy.</p>

<p>The Etruscans are possibly related to the survivors of Troy, who fled to Italy, and the Greeks were the heirs of the destroyers of Troy. The myth of Troy, told in the two epic poems <em>The__Iliad</em> (about the war of Troy) and <em>The Odyssey</em> (about the long and failing attempt to go home from Troy by the main architect of Troy’s defeat, Ulysses), are at the basis of Western civilization and the inspiration for the main poem of the Roman Empire, Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em>.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 The Phoenicians of Carthage</strong></p>

<p>At the turn of the first millennium BC, when the Zhou Dynasty in China had established its control over the central plains, taking over from the Shang Dynasty, the Phoenicians were already in Italy or its proximity. There is archeological evidence of their presence at the western tip of Sicily, in Motya, where they had ostensibly set up production of salt from seawater7, and they had already founded Palermo, their main stronghold on the island, the main bridge for their operations reaching all of Italy, and the future capital of Sicily.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is the literary testimony of the meeting between Aeneas, fleeing Troy and reaching the area where modern Rome was to be founded hundreds of years later.</p>

<p>The story told by Virgil in the <em>Aeneid</em> is particularly intriguing8. It tells of Aeneas passing through Carthage, then ruled by Queen Dido. Dido falls in love with Aeneas and gets pregnant by him, but then Aeneas moves to the Italian peninsula, prisoner of his fate to found the future “caput mundi”, capital of the world. That is, at the time of the first Roman emperor, Augustus, Romans believed Carthage was significantly more ancient than Rome and believed they shared some of the same blood line (Aeneas’ love story with Dido). Moreover, according to Virgil, Dido committed suicide when Aeneas left and cast a curse on him, asking his progeny to seek revenge on Aeneas’ progeny, a poetic reference to the three wars Rome had to fight against Carthage for control of the Mediterranean Sea in third century BC. But most importantly Romans admitted they had had ties and intercourse with the Phoenicians since their foundation, actually even before their foundation.</p>

<p>Virgil’s story is consistent with some of the testimony of historic texts at the time9 reporting Phoenician presence in what is now Northern Tunisia in the second millennium BC. However, other historical records put the foundation of the city at a much later date. Carthage means “new city” and was founded in the 8th century BC, around the beginning of the Spring and Autumn period in China, by a group of fugitives from Tyre, then one of the most important cities in Phoenicia.</p>

<p>All we know about Carthage comes from Roman sources or Greek sources which the Romans felt comfortable with. All testimonies of Carthaginian literature, which might have been very extensive since the city was a dominant power in the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC, are gone. This may be the outcome of a deliberate action by the Roman Empire, which wanted to erase all the history of its greatest challenge to power. All the preserved memory of Carthage is what the Romans wanted their people and us to know, so we have to take this memory with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>We know it was first a monarchy, held by Queen Dido, also known as Elissa, running away from a power struggle in Tyre where her brother, contending for the crown, was killed. Later it became a republic with a Senate and possibly with a structure similar to that of republican Rome. They were Semitic, with a Canaanite religion and a Canaanite language, close to ancient Aramaic, the language spoken later by Jesus and Jews of his time. They believed in an afterlife, similar to the beliefs of ancient Egypt. When the physical body dies, the <em>npš</em> (usually translated as “soul”) departs the body for the land of Mot, the Semitic god of afterlife, resembling the its Greek counterpart, Hades. Bodies were buried with goods, and offerings of food and drink were made to the dead to ensure that they would not bother the living. Dead relatives were venerated and sometimes asked for help, as also happened in ancient Rome. Also the three main gods of the Greeks—Zeus, ruling the sky; Poseidon, in charge of the seas; and Hades, controlling the afterlife—mirror the division of the Phoenician gods Baal, Yam, and Mot. Even the story of the labors of Hercules takes from the legend of the Tyrian Melkart, often equated with Heracles.</p>

<p>Their very name came from their main craft, “traders in purple,” referring to their monopoly on the precious purple dye of the Murex snail, used, among other things, for royal clothing. The name comes from the Greek <em>Φοίνικες</em> (<em>Phoínikes</em>), documented since Homer and influenced by <em>phoînix</em> (Tyrian purple) and crimson (<em>murex</em>) (itself from <em>phoinós</em> “blood red”).10 The word stems from Mycenean <em>po-ni-ki-jo</em> and <em>po-ni-ki</em>, ultimately borrowed from ancient Egyptian <em>fnḥw</em> (<em>fenkhu</em>)11: Asiatics, Semites. The etymological association of <em>phoiniki</em> with <em>phoînix</em> mirrors that in Akkadian which tied <em>kinaḫni</em>, <em>kinaḫḫi</em> (Canaan, Phoenicia) to <em>kinaḫḫu</em> (red-dyed wool).12 The land was natively known as <em>knʿn</em> (cf. Eblaite <em>ca-na-na-um</em>, <em>ca-na-na</em>), and remembered in the 6th century BC by Hecataeus under the Greek form <em>Chna</em> (χνα), and its people as the <em>knʿny</em> (cf. Punic <em>chanani</em>, Hebrew <em>kanaʿani</em>).</p>

<p>As we saw, they exported dyed wool and glass. They sold wine to Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, and were paid with Nubian gold. They were the first extensive seafarers of the Mediterranean Sea. Their culture started flourishing around the 13th century BC, about the time of the war between Troy and the Achaean allies. In fact, the rise of the Phoenician power occurred around 1200 BC when something unclear took place. This event is historically associated with the appearance of the Sea Peoples from the north, possibly the Achaeans who allegedly destroyed Troy. The result was the weakening and destruction of the new Egyptian kingdom and the Hittite kingdom in Anatolia and modern Syria. There was a cultural collapse, interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy13. In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.</p>

<p>The Phoenicians were merchants and pirates certainly competing with the Greeks later and possibly even with the Achaeans in earlier times, dominating an area somehow larger than modern Lebanon. They did not make up an organized state structure, but rather were a group of independent cities possibly united in a league, similar to their Greek competitors. For centuries they were fending off attacks from the south, as Egypt was branching out, and from the east, as the Hittites and Assyrians were pushing in.</p>

<p>Sitting at the crossroads of Mesopotamia and the Egyptian civilizations, they possibly fused both elements. The first had a cuneiform writing symbolizing phonetic syllables (roughly similar to modern Japanese Katagana or Hiragana), and the second had a pictographic writing roughly similar to Chinese ideograms. The Phoenicians are credited with being the first to invent a modern alphabet. The symbols were possibly derived from Egyptians pictograms, but more importantly they introduced a conceptual revolution in the art of writing meanings and sounds. They ignored the meaning (which is the main content of pictograms or ideograms) and focused on conveying the sound (which was already roughly the content of cuneiforms). However, they ignored syllables (which are the first perceived division of sounds) and broke sounds into their essential components, vowels and consonants. Syllables in fact can number in hundreds if not thousands (English has some 3,000 syllables, Chinese has over 400), which begs for hundreds if not thousands of signs.</p>

<p>Therefore both syllabic and pictographic writings have hundreds if not thousands of signs to learn by heart, something extremely complicated to master without years of constant and devoted practice. But when syllables are broken into vowels and consonants, a mere score of symbols can render millions of different sounds and syllables, as proven by the successful usage of alphabets for thousands of languages over thousands of years. Plus alphabets can be mastered in a matter of days by anybody.</p>

<p>An alphabet thus made a very convenient and useful tool for sea traders meeting all kinds of people, speaking all kinds of languages, and needing to make a quick agreement on the price of the merchandise to be exchanged. Written language stopped thus being an instrument of chosen people, secretive rulers, who could afford years of training, and became an easy tool uniting an open community of traders which wanted to find an easy common ground to communicate and exchange goods in long term, fairly transparent relationship.</p>

<p>Alphabets spread quickly from the Phoenicians. Greeks, fellow and competing sea traders, adopted and changed it. So did the Etruscans and then the Romans, who begot the Latin script adopted worldwide.</p>

<p>In Virgil’s story, written in the 1st century BC, there are some historical problems regarding Aeneas and Carthage. Historical testimonies from ancient times put the Troy war, from which Aeneas and his people fled, in the late second millennium BC. Eratosthenes places in 1184 BC, Herodotus in 1250 BC, and Duris of Samos in 1334 BC14. That is, there is a gap of a few centuries between the modern historical assessment about the foundation of Carthage and the myth reported by the Roman poet Virgil, who must have known about Herodotus’ and Eratosthenes’ dating of the Troy War. This is but one example of the many difficulties in reconciling extant knowledge in ancient history. The myth reported by Virgil however squares with our knowledge of the rise of the Phoenician power, which took place at the time of the legendary war of Troy, a historical fact for the Romans of the time. Then Virgil seems to tell us the Romans believed that Phoenicians kept aloof with the war, siding neither with Troy nor with the Achaeans, but taking advantage of the disruption brought in by the war.</p>

<p>In any event, the independent cities in ancient Phoenicia succumbed to the Persian invasion in the late 6th century BC, and when Persia attacked Greece, around 500 BC, Carthage was starting to build an empire in the western Mediterranean. Here Carthage apparently organized a political and military system centered on itself, no longer consisting of independent cities, as in Phoenicia, and here it met its old enemies, the Greeks. The main battleground was Sicily, where Carthaginians were concentrated in the west and Greeks were in the east and center. Carthage also at least partly controlled the coasts of Sardinia and Corsica, all closer to the North African coast, the main basis of Carthaginian power.</p>

<p>The fight with the Greeks went on for centuries. For the first time, the Greeks used against the Carthaginians of Motya the first catapult, a machine that was to be the cornerstone of siege war until the introduction of cannons over a thousand years later. The historian Diodorus Siculus (about 1st century BC), described the invention of a mechanical arrow-firing catapult (<em>katapeltikon</em>) by a Greek task force in 399 BC.15 The weapon was soon after employed against Motya (397 BC) by the great Greek leader Dionysius 1st of Syracuse, the man who became the main inspiration for Plato’s theory in his <em>Republic</em>.</p>

<p>Yet the Greeks failed for centuries to expel the Carthaginians from Sicily, whereas the Carthaginians came to command the support of some Greek cities in Italy during the Second Punic War. The defense of Syracuse was organized by Archimedes, one of the greatest mathematicians of all times. Archimedes is said to have used for the first time special large lenses able to concentrate the sun’s ray on Roman enemy boats and thus to set them on fire.</p>

<p>In fact, as early as 509 BC—that is at time of the Persian attack on Greece—Carthage and Rome (then just beginning to be a republic) had an agreement dividing areas of influence16 in Italy. The islands (Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica) were given to Carthage. At the time, the Greek colonies in Italy were bereft of support from the Greek motherland, locked in a war for survival against Persia. Carthage then became the main trading city of the western Mediterranean.</p>

<p><strong>1.3 The Etruscans</strong></p>

<p>The Etruscans are certainly the most mysterious of the three great civilization occupying Italy before the Roman rise. Their origin has remained uncertain for centuries, and only recently has there been a little more light shed on it. Until a few years ago it even appeared they did not have a writing system, but the Etruscan alphabet, derived from the Greek alphabet, was discovered recently.</p>

<p>In antiquity there were three versions of the origin of this people speaking a non-Indo-European language. Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC claimed they hailed from Lydia, in the modern Anatolia peninsula17. A second version, referred to by Dyonisis of Halicarnassus in the 1st century BC, says the Etruscans were a local people; the third maintains they came from the north, interpreting a passage by Titus Livy. Their origins in the Middle East appears confirmed according to some DNA studies at the University of Turin conducted among the modern local population18. Moreover some recent linguistic studies found that the Etruscan language could be related to that of the island of Lemnos, in the Aegean Sea, next to Anatolia19. However another study conducted in 2013 suggested that the Etruscans were probably an indigenous population. The study compared DNA extracted from ancient Etruscan tombs, medieval tombs, and modern DNA20. Another interesting element is a DNA study of cattle from modern Tuscany. It found that their DNA was similar to that of cattle from Anatolia21. It is likely the Etruscan civilization, which was extremely original as we shall see, blended all three elements22.</p>

<p>As ancient tradition and modern findings point at the Etruscans coming from Anatolia, where Troy was and where the Trojan War took place, it is very likely then to think of a migration from that region to central Italy, which blended with local populations. This might have given rise to the notion of the Trojan origin of the Etruscans, something that later the Romans took over to ennoble their own origin, as we shall see.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.1: Elements of the Etruscan civilization</strong></p>

<p>One significant element is that they might also had a connection with the Nuraghi, from Sardinia. Etruscans were also known as <em>Tyrsenoi</em>, from which comes the ancient and present name of the sea on the west side of Italy down to Sicily, Tyrrhenian, the sea of the <em>Tyrsenoi</em>. There appears to be some reference to their name in ancient Egyptian literature of the 13th century BC, and the name <em>Tyrsenoi</em> seems to mean “builders of towers” (<em>turris</em> in Latin), something we know the Sardinian Nuraghi specialized in. We know the Etruscans also built towers, of which we now have no remains. Moreover in the monuments that have survived there are elements from Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Mesopotamia, and Indo-Iran.23</p>

<p>Yet definitely there is also an original component to the Etruscan origin in the civilization from Villanova, which started in the late second millennium BC and where we have some specialized workings of copper and silver. These people settled on the hilltops, in possibly defensive positions. Around the 9th century BC these populations moved to the plains. In this time we appear to have an expansion of the cities, which are made of square houses with or without a chimney (those without chimney were possibly stables or shacks) with some distance between each other, perhaps for agriculture purposes.</p>

<p>The cities were built starting from two main lines, roads/streets, of which we have the Latin names as Rome inherited the tradition: one north-south (<em>cardo</em>) and one east-west (<em>decumano</em>). The crossing divided the cities into sectors (<em>insulae</em>), which could be further divided up by other lines. In at least one city we have remains of a public bath, a tradition later widely used in Rome. We also found a fork for eating, an instrument that apparently later disappeared, and was reinvented in Tuscany during the Renaissance, some 2,000 years later.</p>

<p>High walls, mostly with four or seven gates, often corresponding with cardo and decumano streets, surrounded the cities. The walls were made of clay and tuff stone. The cities were independent and ruled by priest-kings called <em>lucomones</em> and supported by a council of elders. Later there was also a council of elected magistrates called Zilath. At the height of their power, the Etruscans had formed a league of 12 cities, which would support each other. This league fought against the encroaching Phoenicians and Greeks.</p>

<p>Religion played a huge role in their life. Complex burial rituals and tombs have been found, and we know of three different classes of priests able to foresee the future: the <em>augures</em>, who studied the flight of birds; the <em>aurispices</em>, who read the destiny in the entrails of the animals, especially the liver and the intestines, which were butchered and cut up; and the <em>fulguratores</em>, who read the future by interpreting the lightening in the sky. The coexistence of three kinds of priests also seems to point to the blending of three very different cultural traditions. The future could not be changed but by using special rituals and sacrifices.</p>

<p>They also used circumcision, not usual for people of the north Mediterranean, and violent games later popular in Rome. There is evidence of bull-fights and gladiators’ games.</p>

<p>The Etruscan army24 was made of a heavily equipped phalanx, shaped like the Greek phalanx. They were armed with spear, sword, a large round shield, and some front armor and bronze protection for the shins. They were in small numbers, made of common citizens constantly training. There were also light infantry with little or no armor who used arrows and slings, and some with only a helmet and axes to cut spears of the enemy phalanx.</p>

<p>The military equipment was compulsory and at personal expense; therefore the military role was determined by the social class of the soldier. From later Roman literature we know there were six classes of military people further divided in four age classes. Only the richer would become <em>oplites,</em> heavily armed phalanx soldiers; the others were more lightly equipped. The four ages were the elders (46 years old and above), the young ones (between 17 and 46), the children (between 8 and 17), and the infants (below 8).</p>

<p>They are known to be expert mariners. Their ships were about 30 meters long, moved mostly by oarsmen placed in one or two rows. Sails were used only as an aid, not as the main engine for movement. They attacked other ships by casting sliding bridges across and boarding the enemy ship with infantry waiting on a higher bridge. They were the first in Western antiquity known to have used trumpets in attacks (to scare the enemy) and anchors. Military expeditions were stopped in the winter months. The break in the winter and minimal use of sails seems to indicate that like their competitors, the Greeks and Phoenicians, they ventured little in high seas and moved rather along the coasts. Therefore they might have reached Sardinia faring from Elba Island west to Corsica then south to Sardinia.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.2 The beginning of the history of engineering</strong></p>

<p>The Etruscans might well not be the first engineers of the ancient world—many of their techniques were known in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Yet most likely they were the first to pass these techniques to Rome and the mastery of these ancient technologies contributed to the notion of their oriental origin.</p>

<p>Their two contributions, developing the water system and using the arch as a building technique, were fundamental to urban development in Roman times and later to the very thinking of cities and the countryside in the West.</p>

<p>One of their accomplishments was the draining of the swamps in the plains of modern Tuscany, around Orbetello. Pipings made of clay and bronze were found25 and so were drainage channels cut in stone with barriers and holes to prevent stoppages during rains or floods. These techniques made it possible to reclaim from the swamps much fertile land and thus granted ample harvests.</p>

<p>The drains were also applied to urban settlements where we find some of the first sewage systems. Later the “<em>cloaca massima</em>” Rome’s sewage system, one of the most ancient in the world, was built using Etruscan engineers around the 7th century BC at the time when Rome was under Etruscan rule with Tarquinio Prisco, the fifth king of Rome and the first of certain Etruscan lineage26. That points to a very mature technology at the time, fully applied in other Etruscan cities, as Rome was then not a major Etruscan settlement. The sewage and the drainage system made living conditions in cities and the country much safer for living and thus must have helped increase agricultural production and population density.</p>

<p>Italian Etruscologist Mario Lopes Pegna says, “the Etruscans were the first to tackle and solve the problem of land improvement, and did so by a series of technical operations so ingenious as to arouse admiration even in our days. A complicated skillfully constructed network of canals collected surplus and stagnant water throughout Etruria and Latium. These waters were then channeled to wherever they were needed for farming purposes, and any excess still remaining was carried in big drains down to the sea… The Etruscans first developed the technique of dry farming and applied it to the arid soils of the Maremma hills”27</p>

<p>Again, the technology might have not been original. One of the first known sanitation systems was built in the southeast of modern Iran near Zabol. This seems to point to a route of passage, as even earlier findings of sanitation systems were found among the Hindu valley civilizations. The ancient cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus valley constructed complex networks of brick-lined sewage drains from around 2600 BC and also had flush toilets connected to this network28. From there we find that the ancient Minoan civilization in Crete (also speaking a non-Indo-European language and using a syllabic script) had stone-and-clay sewers for the upper class that were periodically flushed with clean water29.</p>

<p>However it was the Etruscans through their Roman heirs that spread sewers, drainage, and water technology throughout the world.</p>

<p>The same is true for another important building technique, the arch. There is no doubt that the ancient Romans learned the arch from the Etruscans, refined it, and were the first builders to tap its full potential for above-ground buildings: “The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, fully to appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault, and the dome.”30 They widely used them in their construction starting with their aqueducts.</p>

<p><strong>1.4 Elements of a history of cement and establishment of different traditions</strong></p>

<p>It is not clear whether the Etruscans knew cement as a water-resistant building material. Architectural remains of the Minoan civilization in Crete show evidence of the combined use of slaked lime and finely ground potsherds for waterproofing baths, cisterns, and aqueducts as early as in 2000 BC31. Phoenicians and ancient Israelis made use of it too32. Evidence of the use of volcanic materials such as volcanic ashes or tuffs by the ancient Greeks dates back to at least 500–400 BC, as uncovered at the ancient city of Kameiros on island of Rhodes33.But certainly the Romans made large use of cement derived from volcanic ashes found near Mount Vesuvius in Pozzuoli. From this came the ancient name for cement as “<em>pozzolan</em>” (from Pozzuoli).</p>

<p>As the ashes are of volcanic origin and can be found also further north in the Apennines and as the Etruscans were known engineers, there is also some speculation that cement of some sort could have been used by Etruscans as well. This would make sense as the use of pozzolan is important since cement has to be used in work dealing with water, something that the Etruscans were known for, as we saw, from drainage to sewages. Pozzolan and arches (of certain Etruscan origin) are fundamental to the Roman aqueducts, one of the hallmarks of Roman civilization.</p>

<p>The word “cement” itself traces to the Romans, who used the term <em>opus caementicium</em> to describe masonry resembling modern concrete made from crushed rock with burnt lime as the binder.</p>

<p>What we have here is a building material that is very cheap and efficient to produce and at the same time also extremely solid and lasting. All in all cheaper, faster, and more solid than, say, building with wood and pressed earth, the two methods used for instance in China and most of the world before the widespread introduction of cement.</p>

<p>Cement is an efficient procedure. You crush volcanic stones, burn the resulting powder and then, when you want to use it, add water, some sand and put it between bricks, which are made of clay and cooked in oven at medium-high temperatures. The resulting structure is extremely resilient, as proven by the Roman architectural remains all over the Mediterranean. It can’t be simply burnt down—one has to use a precise act of systematic demolition to tear it down. This one important element that helped preserve Roman remains in the West compared to the lack of relics in China.</p>

<p>The other elements are cultural, but certainly the overall result, the existence still of buildings that are thousands of years old, could have been more difficult without the material support of cement.</p>

<p>The cultures that gave solidity to cement, and gained solidity from cement, are very complex, and we shall examine them in this work. Now briefly we can mention one important fact that is strikingly different from China’s history. In the Western tradition there was just one empire to which all aspired to return: the Roman empire, which lasted some incredibly over 2,000 years, from the mythical foundation of Rome in 753 BC to the fall of Constantinople at the hands of the Turks in 1453.</p>

<p>Both the beginning and the end of this time can be stretched because Rome prided itself on being the heir of Troy, a kingdom that fell in 12-13th century BC but that was founded possibly a thousand years earlier and was inspired by ancient Egypt, a civilization stretching to 5,000 years before Christ. A material proof of this legacy can be found in the Macuteo obelisk, created during the period of Pharaoh Ramses 2nd (13th century BC), which is in Rome now. It was brought from Egypt by the ancient Romans and put before the Pantheon (a Roman temple turned into a church with a vault built according to Etruscan techniques) and solidly hooked to Renaissance-era fountain by cement. The continuity of the Roman empire can also be found in America, the present superpower, which defines itself in the language of ancient Rome, in Latin, “e pluribus unum” (from many, one), and preserves the Roman symbol as its own—the eagle. In some ways Rome is still alive, offering one more reason to treasure the solid monuments made of very solid cement. Moreover, the Catholic Church, an important reference for the Christian and monotheistic world, still dons the robes and garbs of the late western Roman empire, and its headquarters is symbolically housed in Rome, still the center of the empire.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in China one had fragile buildings made with expensive wood and pressed earth, also built with great toil. There were bricks from ancient times but the mortar was made of straw and clay, much weaker than cement. All of these buildings could be easily torched and torn down. Moreover, in ancient times there was some kind of stronger cement made of sticky rice, used to link bricks. In fact, hydraulic mortar was not available in ancient China, possibly due to a lack of volcanic ash. Around AD 500, sticky rice soup was mixed with slaked lime to make an inorganic-organic composite mortar that had more strength and water resistance than lime mortar.34 But the Chinese composite was far more expensive and difficult to produce than Roman ash and stone cement.</p>

<p>Moreover, this material fragility was also grounded in a cultural worldview. The first Chinese emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, unified his empire at the turn of 3rd to 2nd century BC by systematically erasing all preceding kingdoms—their monuments, coins, script, roads et cetera—so that no memory of the past would survive and only the memory of his own kingdom would last into the future. This practice was not his invention. Starting with the wars among small statelets in the central plains of China at least since the 8th century BC, dozens (if not hundreds, the extant literature refers to <em>wan guo</em> (万国) existing at the time) of statelets were “erased” (_mie_灭). Only some of their names have survived in the official history. Their literature, buildings, traditions, and monuments have all disappeared. That is, the warring states of ancient China not only occupied defeated territories but imposed on the beaten party a whole new set of rules, so that effectively their own past was “exterminated.” Only modern archeology and present archeological findings can attempt to restore some of that past memory, which should be known to of all Chinese, as all modern Chinese are at least partly children of those exterminated cultures as well as children of the exterminating culture35.</p>

<p>So when emperor Qin imposed his own unified order on all the central plains, he had a strong, well established precedent, which was justified by a necessity of unified administration (we shall see later a difference in administration of Rome and ancient China). That is at least for the past half a millennium, but likely going back much longer, China felt that to unify a state it had to destroy all that belonged to the previous state, and certainly buildings and monuments of the past were the most representative symbols that something existed before the present order. Moreover, these buildings were easy to tear down, being made of wood and pressed earth. The burning of books and circulation of only permitted books and thoughts is also part of this general attitude.</p>

<p>Of course, the same fate happened to the Qin when it fell, and a new dynasty, the Han, established itself on the basis of the Qin unification, trying to erase all legacy of Qin and founding its own monumental legacy also established with book of history, shi ji 史记 (by Sima Tan and Sima Qian), the canon of historical continuity based on a tradition theorized by Confucius and Mencius. That is, a dynasty will fall if it loses the mandate of heaven (tian ming 天命), and then there will be a change in the mandate of heaven (ge ming 革命), and a new dynasty will step in. In other words, there is not one empire that is the hub of Chinese history like the Roman Empire is in the West. In China the dynasties succeeding one another are all trying to keep the mandate of heaven and they all eventually fail to do so. Then there are no physical monuments to be preserved as evidence of continuity with the past. On the contrary, every dynasty has to establish itself symbolically and thus replace the artworks of the past, which remind people of the earlier, defeated dynasty. In a way the continuity of Chinese civilization without physical proof is a matter of deep faith, something almost religious, embodied in the language and literature telling this history.</p>

<p>But if Westerners can go to Rome and see and touch the Macuteo obelisk and thus know their continuity with the past, the Chinese cannot find monuments that for millennia have been physical evidence of continuity. Only modern archeology (a discipline imported from the West), by digging up long-lost ancient remains, is reshaping the modern sense of a relationship with the past in China.</p>

<p>As we shall see, many other elements contributed to this, but the presence of cement made it easier for the West to have remains, while conversely, the absence of cement made it easier also to push in the other direction.</p>
